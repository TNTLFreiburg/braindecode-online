Add replay and parameter saving to the bdonline server 

server_save_and_replay.py is a rewritten version of the standard server 
that loads in data and receives indexes
from index_sender.py to step through the data and replay the experiment.
Data_receiver class was adapted to this purpose. 
xdf_to_bd.py transforms the xdf file
into the format bdonline would recognise(nchannelsx time, labels last row).
Launch_command.txt contains some parameters that can be used to start the server
predictors.py summed up the log softmax predictions before exponentiating them
which lead to predictions not summing to 1.
